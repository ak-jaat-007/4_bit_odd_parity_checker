# 4-Bit Odd Parity Checker

This is a CMOS-based 4-bit odd parity checker using transmission gates, designed in Microwind and simulated using NGSpice.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **Microwind**: Layout design of XOR gates and inverter-based parity logic.
- **NGSpice**: Simulation of logic behavior.

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Inputs: 4-bit input (A, B, C, D)
- Logic: XOR all four bits using transmission gate logic
- Output: HIGH if the number of 1s is odd, LOW otherwise

## 📁 Files Included
- `.msk` file — CMOS layout in Microwind
- `.cir` / `.sp` file — Spice netlist for simulation
- Screenshots — Output waveforms and layout view
